# LangChain Tutorial Repository

This repository is dedicated to following the LangChain tutorial series. The structure of this project is organized as follows:

- `nbs/`: Contains individual directories for each tutorial, each with its own code and resources.
- `langchain_tutorial/`: Houses general code applicable across multiple tutorials.

## Tutorials

1. [ ] [Build a Simple LLM Application with LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/llm_chain/)

   - Learn how to create a basic Language Model application using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).

2. [ ] [Build a Chatbot](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/chatbot/)

   - Learn how to build a chatbot that can maintain conversation history and provide personalized responses.
   - Explore techniques for managing large message histories and implementing streaming for improved user experience.

3. [ ] [Vector Store and Retrieval](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/retrievers/)
   - Explore LangChain's vector store and retriever abstractions for efficient data retrieval.
   - Learn how to integrate retrieved data with LLM workflows.
   - Understand the importance of these abstractions in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.
   - Gain hands-on experience with fetching and utilizing data for model inference.
   - Discover how to enhance LLM performance by providing relevant context through retrieval.

More tutorials will be added as we progress through the series.
